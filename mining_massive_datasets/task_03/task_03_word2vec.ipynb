    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to obtain the vector representations for words from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that words appearing in similar contexts have similar meanings. Because of that, word vectors of similar words should be close together. Models that use word vectors can utilize these properties, e.g., in sentiment analysis a model will learn that \"good\" and \"great\" are positive words, but will also generalize to other words that it has not seen (e.g. \"amazing\") because they should be close together in the vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors can keep other language properties as well, like analogies. The question \"a is to b as c is to ...?\", where the answer is d, can be answered by looking into word vector space and calculating $\\mathbf{u}_b - \\mathbf{u}_a + \\mathbf{u}_c$, and finding the word vector that is the closest to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a text that contains $N$ unique words $\\{ x_1, ..., x_N \\}$. We will focus on the Skip-Gram model in which the goal is to predict the context window $S = \\{ x_{i-l}, ..., x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, ..., x_{i+l} \\}$ from current word $x_i$, where $l$ is the window size. \n",
    "\n",
    "We get a word embedding $\\mathbf{u}_i$ by multiplying the matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ with a one-hot representation $\\mathbf{x}_i$ of a word $x_i$. Then, to get output probabilities for context window, we multiply this embedding with another matrix $\\mathbf{V}$ and apply softmax. The objective is to minimize the loss: $-\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[P(S|x_i;\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V})]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a dataset with positive and negative reviews. Your task is to:\n",
    "+ Construct input-output pairs corresponding to the current word and a word in the context window\n",
    "+ Implement forward and backward propagation with parameter updates for Skip-Gram model\n",
    "+ Train the model\n",
    "+ Test it on word analogies and sentiment analysis task"
